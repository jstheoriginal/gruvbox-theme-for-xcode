# Gruvbox Theme for Xcode!

An Xcode theme that colour-matches the wonderful gruvbox theme for vim! [The gruvbox vim repo](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) describes its theme as: 

> Designed as a bright theme with pastel 'retro groove' colors and light/dark mode switching in the way of solarized. The main focus when developing gruvbox is to keep colors easily distinguishable, contrast enough and still pleasant for the eyes.

1. Close Xcode.
1. Open Finder then from the menu bar choose `Go` -> `Go to folder...`.
1. Paste `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes/` into the pop-up to open your Xcode themes folder.

_**Note:** The theme is set to use SF Mono (San Francisco Mono). The font used in the screenshot is [DejaVu Sans Mono for Powerline](https://github.com/powerline/fonts/tree/master/DejaVuSansMono) if you want to use it._
